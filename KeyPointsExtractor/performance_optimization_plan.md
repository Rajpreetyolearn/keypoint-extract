# Performance Optimization Plan for Key Points Extractor

## Current Performance Issues Identified

1. **Synchronous API calls** - OpenAI API calls taking 3+ seconds
2. **Sequential document processing** - Processing chunks one by one
3. **Vector store recreation** - Creating new vector store for each request
4. **No caching mechanism** - Repeated processing of similar content
5. **Large document chunking** - Processing entire documents at once

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (1-2 days)

#### 1.1 Implement Async Processing
- Convert OpenAI API calls to async
- Use `asyncio.gather()` for parallel document processing
- Implement async document chunking

**Expected Improvement**: 40-60% speed increase

#### 1.2 Smart Document Chunking
- Implement intelligent text chunking based on content type
- Use sliding window approach for better context
- Optimize chunk sizes for different document types

**Expected Improvement**: 20-30% speed increase

#### 1.3 Request Batching
- Batch multiple small requests together
- Implement request queuing system
- Process similar documents in batches

**Expected Improvement**: 25-35% speed increase

### Phase 2: Caching & Memory Optimization (2-3 days)

#### 2.1 Multi-Level Caching System
```
Level 1: In-memory cache (Redis/Memcached)
Level 2: Document fingerprint cache
Level 3: Processed results cache
```

#### 2.2 Vector Store Optimization
- Implement persistent vector store
- Use incremental updates instead of recreation
- Implement vector store pooling

#### 2.3 Content Deduplication
- Hash-based duplicate detection
- Similar content identification
- Reuse existing processing results

**Expected Improvement**: 50-70% speed increase for repeated content

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (3-5 days)

#### 3.1 Model Optimization
- Use smaller, faster models for initial filtering
- Implement model cascading (fast â†’ accurate)
- Fine-tune prompts for efficiency

#### 3.2 Preprocessing Pipeline
- OCR result caching
- Text quality pre-filtering
- Content type detection optimization

#### 3.3 Infrastructure Improvements
- Implement connection pooling
- Use HTTP/2 for API calls
- Optimize memory usage patterns

**Expected Improvement**: 30-50% additional speed increase

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (5-7 days)

#### 4.1 Streaming Processing
- Implement streaming responses
- Progressive result delivery
- Real-time status updates

#### 4.2 Load Balancing & Scaling
- Multiple API key rotation
- Request load balancing
- Horizontal scaling support

#### 4.3 Intelligent Routing
- Route requests based on complexity
- Use different models for different content types
- Implement fallback mechanisms
